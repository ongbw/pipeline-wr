About pipeline-wr
==========

An C-MPI based implementation of pipeline waveform relaxation emthods using
Neumann-Neumann and Dirichlet-Neumann transmission conditions. This
is unsupported research-level code that accompanies the submitted paper
[Pipeline Implementations of Neumann-Neumann and Dirichlet-Neumann Waveform Relaxation methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08503)
